## Apprenticeship
Project I did for a redesign of the Instagram web login page. The color inspiration came from the mobile version of the app. Some of the key things I learned and enhanced in this project were:
* **Responsiveness:** I designed the web version with overall responsiveness in mind, which reduced the need for extensive media queries to make it responsive.
* **Element positioning:** I made extensive use of flex and visualized the elements as boxes in my mind, which made positioning them much easier.
* **Password hiding functionality:** It was simpler than I had imagined, and I plan to incorporate more interactions in future projects.

## Future Enhancements
I plan to use this project to learn how to create a version in another language. There's also the possibility of continuing with a project that includes more Instagram pages. This experience was a lot of fun :)
